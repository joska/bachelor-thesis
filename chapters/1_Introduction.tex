\par The goal of this thesis is to gather and analyse the requirements for the Production database for the Inner Tracker upgrade project and in the next step, based on the findings, to propose and implement the standalone API Web Service application that is meeting the required demands with an example endpoint to demonstrate its functionality. The API application should be functional, usable and deployable.

\par The purpose of the API is to enable fast and easy access to the database data for users and also the 3rd party applications. The content of the thesis includes the process of gathering of necessary materials for a proper development and selection of the API type for data of the ITk database.

\par It results in relevant selection of programming languages and technologies (on premise and cloud services) for the implementation. A special is given to the matter of authorisation and user privileges handling. The full list and descriptions of proposed endpoints and their mockups is included as a part of the design proposal and the implementation of API application is demonstrated with the selected API endpoint.
