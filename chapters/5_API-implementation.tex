\section{Materials}
\par The following part of the thesis is the implementation of the REST API layer and the implementation of a web interface.
	
\par The API Layer provides the data source for all 3th party tools and services, including the web interface and possible handheld applications. Considering the nature of the database content, special care is given to the authorisation and user privileges handling, so no unauthorised user is able to access or change the database content.
